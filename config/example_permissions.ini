; Basics:
; - Semicolons are comment characters, any line that starts with one is ignored.
; - Sections headers are permissions groups, they're the lines that have a word in [Brackets].  You can add more for more permissions groups.
; - Options with a semicolon before them will be ignored.
; - Add whatever permissions you want, but always have at least one.
; - Never have an options without a value, i.e. "CommandBlacklist = "
; - [Default] is a special section.  Any user that doesn't get assigned to a group via role or UserList gets assigned to this group.
;
;
; Option info:
;
;    [Groupname]
;    This is the section header.  The word is the name of the group, just name it something appropriate for its permissions.
;
;    CommandWhitelist = command1 command2
;    List of commands users are allowed to use, separated by spaces.  Don't include the prefix, i.e. !  Overrides CommandBlacklist if set.
;
;    CommandBlacklist = command1 command2
;    List if commands users are not allowed to use.  You don't need to use both
;    whitelist and blacklist since blacklist gets overridden.  Just pick one.
;
;    GrantToRoles = 111222333444555 999888777000111
;    List of ids to automatically grant this group to.  To get the id of a role, use the listids command.
;
;    UserList = 21343341324 321432413214321
;    List of user ids to grant this group to.  This option overrides the role granted by the GrantToRoles option.
;
;    InstaSkip = no
;    Allows the user to skip a song without having to vote, like the owner.
