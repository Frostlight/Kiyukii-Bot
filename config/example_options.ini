; The bot must be restarted for edits to take effect, but a reload command will be created in the future.

; Example:
;	CommandPrefix = *
; This means the commands you use in chat are *play, *skip, etc.  This explanation exists because it seems no one knows what "prefix" means.

; To get a channel id, enable Developer Mode in discord (settings, appearance), right click a channel, and click Copy ID.
; Example: BindToChannels = 41000000000000005 41000000000000007
